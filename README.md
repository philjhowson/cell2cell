# cell2cell Customer Churn Dataset
***
This dataset is composed of data from Telecom on customer churn. It is a complex dataset
with 57 attributes, that require careful consideration for multicollinearity, missing values,
feature transformations, and model selection. The aim of this project is to correctly
predict customer churn. I am using ROC-AUC and F1-Score to evaluate the performance of each
planned models.
